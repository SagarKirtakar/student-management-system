## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses **MySQL** and consists of the following tables:

- **students**
- **courses**
- **enrollments**

### Relationships

- One Student → Many Enrollments
- One Course → Many Enrollments
- Enrollment stores:
  - Student
  - Course
  - Grade
  - Remarks
  - Status
